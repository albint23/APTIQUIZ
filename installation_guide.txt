There is a forgot password feature. where the reset password link is mailed to the user's registered email id.
to make this feature working you need to add an email id and its password in the following file to send email from this website.

aptiquiz\aptiquiz\info.py (replace the value of EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD in info.py)

also you need to create a passkey for the email and use that here instead of real password. refer the below video for complete django send mail feature.
